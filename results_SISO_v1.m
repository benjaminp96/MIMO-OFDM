%   Description:    a 1x1 SISO OFDM System
%                                   
%   Simulates a 1x1 SISO OFDM system. This system includes the
%   Transmitter: 
%   QAM Modulation, S/P converter, Pilot Insertion IFFT, Add Cyclic Prefix, 
%   P/S converter
%   Channel: 
%   Frequency flat fading Channel modelled by Complex number, AWGN, 
%   Time Offset
%   Receiver: 
%   S/P converter, Removal of Cyclic Prefix, DFT, Channel estimation,  
%   Channel equalisation, P/S converter, QAM Demodulation
%
%   Simulation performs a BER test vs SNR when various time offsets are
%   inputted by sending binary data through the system and measuring the
%   amount of errors at the receiver. Time offsets can be changed beginning
%   on line 138 for different channels.
