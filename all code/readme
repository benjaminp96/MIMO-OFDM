# Code repository
This folder contains the codes used to create the final MATLAB scripts to produce the findings for the investigation. 

Different systems were created one at a time and different sections of the OFDM and MIMO blocks were added to the sytems. 

A single transmitter, single reciever system was first created

Then a two transmitter, single receiver

Then a two transmitter, two receiver

Then a two user, single receiver

Then a two user, two receiver 

Working systems of the above scenarios were created. Then after successful implementation, timing offsets were introduced to produce the results for the investingation
